comparison operators:
Evaluating conditions

== is equal to this operator compares two values (numbers, strings, and booleans) to see if they are the same.

'hello' == 'goodbye' returns false because they are not the same string

'Hello'== 'Hello' returns true. because they are the same string.


3 equal signs === is a strict equal to. so false would be '3' === '3 True would be '3' === '3'

! = is not equal to this operator compares two values ( numbers, strings, or booleans) to see if they are not the same.
'Hello' != 'goodbye' returns true. because they are not the same string.
'Hello' != 'Hello' returns false because they are the same string.

!== strict not equal to
this operator compares to values to check that both data type are not the same values.
'3'!== 3 returns true
'3' !== '3' returns false because the values are the same value.

greater than >
less than <
greater than or equal to >= 
less than or equal to <=

Loops 
loops check to see if a condition is true, a code of block will run, then the condition will be checked again to see if its true. it will continue to run until it returns false.
a For loop uses a counter as a possible counter as a condition. this instructs the code to run a specified number of times. here you can see the condition is made up of three statements.

intialization create a variable and set it to 0. this variable is commonly called i and it acts as a counter. var i= 0;

Condition the loop should continue to run untill the counter reaches a specific number i<10;

Update everytime the the loop has run the statements in the curly braces it adds one more to the counter i++
