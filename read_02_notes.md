Important features include code editor, syntax highlighting, a large quantity of themes to reduce eye strain and fatigue.
a lot of extentions as well.

Code Completions is important to help your code be corrected if slightly off.
some code compeletions include open and closing tags.

Emmet is another great feature to help speed up your coding.
some editors come pre-loaded with ** EMMET **.

Choosing a good editor with alot of themes is great to have because it can help catch issues with your code based on the rules that are set up in the theme.

Macs use text editor.

Plain text has no formatting options.

create a desktop folder so that you can properly organize your website building journey.
Also make sure that the file is properly saved, ie index.html or style.css but file name is not as important as the extension .css .html

There are plenty of 3rd party options notepad++, bb edit, Visual code studio and others.
notepad ++ is windows only.
Text Wrangler is mac only but was retired in 17. you can opt for BB edit but it does cost money.
Visual studio works on all platforms but was originally created for windows.
Atom is similar to Vs in that its is also universal for windows, mac, or linux.

Another important thing to know is what an IDE is (Integrated devlopement Environment)
the nice part of the **IDE** is that it acts like a central client similar to Microsoft outlook.
