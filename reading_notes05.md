## READING NOTES ##
Css is a great for helping make your html better than boring.

I like to think of it like the skin that covers the bones.

Css has code strings and info you will add to your html for better visuals.

this is the part that gets to be alot more fun and adventourus, but can be frustrating.

little misses can cause you to not get the correct information or not work at all.

CSS stands for CASCADING STYLE SHEETS.
