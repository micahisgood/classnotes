what does the **growth mindset** mean to me? I think as people we are always evolving, we are looking to get better at our processes and a explination to what we do everyday.
_I need to keep my priorities staight,for me its my faith first, my marriage and family 2nd, finally leaving this place better than I came into it. I need to remain focused on what my goals are moving forward._
Also I need to know my WHY! My why moving forward is to create a life for my wife and kids that moves us forward together.
