what does the **growth mindset** mean to me? I think as people we are always evolving, we are looking to get better at our processes and a explination to what we do everyday. We do things everyday that people in the 50's, 60's and 70's only wish they could do.
_I need to keep my priorities staight, also I need to know my WHY! My why moving forward is to create a life for my wife and kids that moves us forward together. I want to my kids to know that to get where you want to go in this life it will take hardwork and sacrifce.
Never stop learning and creating._ Also when my wife and I retire we would love to move to Disneyland and become ticket takers.
